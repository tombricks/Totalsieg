-French State is forced to sign a treaty to end the resistance and the mutinies which are getting out of hand
-A cabal of French military officers conspire to overthrow the State
-Enter the Third French Revolution
-French State overthrown with the French Provisional Government, a military junta
-Gerhard Kopfler, Fuhrer of Germany, passes away in 1987 and the Reichstag elects a reformist candidate
-A group of hardcore National Socialists and a faction of the Wehrmacht attempts a coup against the new reformist government
-The Coup fails and public trust in National Socialism falls apart
-The Zivilverwaltungskabinett des Reichskommissars Amerika (Civil Administrative Cabinet of the Reich Commissioner America) holds a vote and affirms that the 1776 Declaration of Independence is still valid and that the Reichskommissariat is subsurvient to no foreign power and that should any foreign power force its will upon them, they will plead the "Right of the People to alter or to abolish it". This is essentially a Second Declaration of Independence and expels the Reichskommissar and its authority. The German Government and Reichskommissariat government loyal claim that their authority comes from the Reichskommissar and that him repel it would be impossible
-The ZVKdRKA declares the Reichskommissariat to become the United States of America and makes themselves the highest authority in the nation by justifying that the Reichskommissar powers, with no one in the position (a clause in the German-American Deals stated that an appointment of the Reichskommissar must be approved by the ZVKdRKA which now refuses to accept anyone), transfer to them. This is all to justify their independence
-German Loyalists rise up in various spaces along the East Coast but are crushed by the USA
-German government begins to implement actual reforms, including a request for all Volksdeutsche and the Reichskommissariat Amerika government to come back to the fatherland. This essentially recognises their independence
-A treaty is signed by the German government and delegates representing Belgium, Netherlands, Ostland, Ukraine, Muscovy etc giving them autonomy over themselves, making them independent
-The treaty comes with Belgium being restored but is divided among (us) ethnic lines and is unstable. Netherlands, ruled by a Dutch fascist movement (probably a reformed NSB) and allied towards Germany, claims Flanders as part of Dietsland.
-Netherlands declares war on Belgium with the puppet "Dutch Republic of Flanders"
-Belgian government collapses
-The French Provisional Government, seeing this as an oppurtunity to prove their might and gain support, intervene in favour of the Belgian governemnt which becomes essentially a French satellite
-Netherlands and their puppet Flanders, with support from the Reich, still manage to come out mostly victorious
-Treaty is signed with the Dutch Republic of Flanders being recognised, Belgium becoming a Wallonian state, and France having some limitations and reparations to make up for "war-mongering"
-French government overthrown once again in the Fourth French Revolution
-French Civil War begins, with the most defined sides being the Military Government, Republicans supporting a democratic (authoritarian to an extent) Republic, and Nationalists who want to go back to "the good ol' days"
