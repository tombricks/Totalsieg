 ns_party_NSDAP_palestine_desc:0 "The Arab-German National Socialist German Party (Arabisch-Deutsche Nationalsozialistische Partei) is the leading political party for the German puppet administration in Palestine, the Großdeutsches Palästinaprotektorat. However, the Palestine Protectorate is unique among the Reich. Most of the Reich has levels of collaboration, but most is still ruled by German officials. The Palestine Protectorate differs from this. Joachim von Ribbentrop is the appointed Reichsgouverneur but much of the day to day is run by local officials, most notably Grand Mufti of Jerusalem Amin al-Husseini who regularly does what the aforementioned Reichsgouverneur should be doing. The Germans care little about the day to day. The primary purpose of the Protectorate is to act as a safe German gateway into the Middle East, where they want to combat Japanese influence and secure it for themselves in the ongoing and ever-growing Cold War. And, with the inevitability of choosing a side becoming ever more clear to the states in the region such as Iraq, the Protectorate may soon have to fulfil its use."

 PAL_RIBBENTROP_DESC:0 "Joachim von Ribbentrop may be well known for being former Reichsminister des Auswärtigen, Reich Minister of Foreign Affairs, but he holds other roles. Most notable of these is the Reichsgouverneur of the Großdeutsches Palästinaprotektorat. As head of the Protectorate, he acts as the representative of the Reich government in Berlin but he does little administrative work himself. Instead, most of the administrating is done by Amin al-Huesseini while Ribbentrop acts as the Reich Ambassador to the Middle East, making power moves to influence the surrounding independent states as the Cold War between the Greater German Reich and the Empire of Japan rages on."

Ribbentrop is the officaial head but most of his activities involve manipulating the situation of the Middle East in the Cold War, slowly swaying it over to the German side."
