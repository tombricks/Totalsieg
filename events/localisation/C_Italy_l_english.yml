 ITA_Overview: "As the 1950s came to an end, all was not well for the Kingdom of Italy. Despite Atlantropa crippling the economy and the inability of the post-war Italian fascist government to govern the Empire in an efficient manner, Mussolini would continue with his grand reforms. These reforms, dubbed the \"Rome Reforms\", would completely transform the Kingdom of Italy and its colonial empire into a fascist totalitarian state under Mussolini, with no opposition, under the aesthetics of a new Roman Empire. However, Mussolini had one key problem he had to overcome: King Umberto II. Umberto II over time became less and less enthusiastic about the Mussolini regime, and would definitely not support these Rome reforms. In order to justify these reforms and bypass the opposing King, Mussolini held a plebiscite to the Italian electorate, with a simple yes or no question over whether they supported these constitutional reforms, including the monarchy being abolished and replaced with a Presidency, tied permanently to the position of Prime Minister. Through mass intimidation and violence, the plebiscite came out in favour. With the monarchy now abolished and the Kingdom reformed into a new Roman Empire, Mussolini now had total control with essentially no legal opposition. However, illegal opposition was not out of the question. Mass riots and protests against the reforms broke out and mass violence caused deaths on the sides of both the Government and the Protestors. The government began to lose grip and local protestors even manage to occupy towns and the industrial north, declaring autonomous zones and the \"Federation of Italy\". The Colonial Empire from Libya to Abyssinia completely separated from the government in Rome and fell into anarchy, or at least more anarchy than already existed there. Germany watched on, at first from a distance, but an active and powerful resistance movement would not be tolerated and the Germans occupied the North and the Colonies with permission from the newly declared Augustus Mussolini. The marching German forces crushed the rebellions and restored order to the revolting territories. After a year of occupation, Mussolini requested that the German forces leave but the Reich refused. As time went on, it became ever more clear that this conquest and occupation of Italian territories by the Reich was not temporary. Since then, the Italian, now Roman, government has never truly gained full control back over their still controlled territories and anger at the Mussolini government is still widespread."
